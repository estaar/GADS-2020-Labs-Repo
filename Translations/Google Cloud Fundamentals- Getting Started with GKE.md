# Task 1: Sign in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console

For each lab, you get a new GCP project and set of resources for a fixed time at no cost.

1. Make sure you signed into Qwiklabs using an **incognito window**.

2. When ready, click ![start_lab](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/XE8x7uvQokyubNwnYKKc%2BvBBNrMlo5iNZiDDzQQ3Ddo%3D).

2. Click **Open Google Console**.

3. Click **Use another account** and copy/paste credentials for this lab into the prompts.

4. Accept the terms and skip the recovery resource page.


# Task 2: Confirm that needed APIs are enabled
1. In GCP console, on the top right toolbar, click the Open Cloud Shell button.

2. Click **Continue**. ![Continue icon](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/lr3PBRjWIrJ%2BMQnE8kCkOnRQQVgJnWSg4UWk16f0s%2FA%3D)
3. Set the default project
``` console
gcloud config set project $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
```

4. Enable **Kubernetes Engine API** and **Container Registry API** API's and Services
``` console
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com

gcloud services enable containerregistry.googleapis.com
```

# Task 3: Start a Kubernetes Engine cluster

1. For convenience, place the zone that Qwiklabs assigned you to into an environment variable called MY_ZONE. At the Cloud Shell prompt, type this command and substitute with the zone assigned to you by qwiklabs:

```console
export MY_ZONE=<zone assignd by qwiklabs>
```

2. Start a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubernetes Engine. Name the cluster webfrontend and configure it to run 2 nodes:

```console
gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2
```
3. After the cluster is created (may take several minutes), check your installed version of Kubernetes using the kubectl version command:
```console
kubectl version
```
View your running nodes in the in compute instances window
```console
gcloud compute instances list
```
# Task 4: Run and deploy a container
1. From your Cloud Shell, launch a single instance of the nginx container.
```console
kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10 --nodes=1
```
In Kubernetes, all containers run in pods. This use of the kubectl create command caused Kubernetes to create a deployment consisting of a single pod containing the nginx container.

2. View the pod running the nginx container:

```console
kubectl get pods
```

3. Expose the nginx container to the Internet via a service and an external load balancer with a public IP address attached to it:

``` console
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer
```

4. View the new service:

```console
kubectl get services
```

5. Use the displayed external IP address to test and contact the nginx container remotely via a webbrowser. It may take a few seconds before the External-IP field is populated for your service. This is normal. Just re-run the kubectl get services command every few seconds until the field is populated.

6. Scale up the number of pods running on your service:

```console
kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3
```

7. Confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods:

```console
kubectl get pods
```

8. Confirm that your external IP address has not changed:

```console
kubectl get services
```

9. Return to the web browser tab in which you viewed your cluster's external IP address. Refresh the page to confirm that the nginx web server is still responding.

# End your lab
When you have completed your lab, click End Lab. Qwiklabs removes the resources youâ€™ve used and cleans the account for you.

You will be given an opportunity to rate the lab experience. Select the applicable number of stars, type a comment, and then click Submit.
